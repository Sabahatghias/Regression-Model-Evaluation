ðŸ”¹ 1. Model Evaluation Metrics for Regression
This notebook demonstrates the use of multiple regression evaluation metrics to assess model performance on a dataset predicting mean altitude of coffee beans. It includes preprocessing, model training using LinearRegression, and evaluation using metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Squared Log Error (MSLE)

Visualizations are included to compare actual vs. predicted values, offering insight into prediction accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Perform Grid Search Using Python
Implements GridSearchCV on a classification task to optimize hyperparameters of a RandomForestClassifier. The dataset involves classifying websites as phishing, legitimate, or suspicious based on extracted web features.

Key highlights:

Parameter tuning using grid search

Accuracy-based evaluation

Train/test split and result reporting

ðŸ”¹ 3. Perform K-Fold Cross Validation Using Python

Applies K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate a classification model that predicts the region of wholesale customers based on their annual spending across various product categories. Utilizes KFold from scikit-learn to perform multiple training/testing cycles for robust model validation.
